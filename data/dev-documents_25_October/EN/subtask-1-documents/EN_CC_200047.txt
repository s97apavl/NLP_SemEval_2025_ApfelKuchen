89% of ‘American Elites’ Back WEF’s Plan to Ration Meat, Gas, Electricity for General Public 

 by Frank Bergman, Slay News:

A disturbing new report has emerged revealing that an overwhelming number of so-called “American elites” support the tyrannical “climate” policies of the World Economic Forum (WEF).

According to a report from the Committee to Unleash Prosperity (CUP), America’s wealthiest citizens fully support the WEF’s plan to ration gas, electricity, and meat and dairy products for the general public in order to allegedly “fight climate change.”

The report includes polling data regarding support for policies designed to force compliance with the WEF’s “Net Zero” agenda.

Astonishingly, the polling shows that almost 90 percent of “American elites” believe strict rationing of gas, meat, and electricity is necessary to combat the so-called “climate crisis.”

The CUP report shows that 77 percent of higher-income Americans overall support these plans.

However, 89 percent of those wealthy individuals from “top universities” believe in restrictions on the public’s quality of life to meet “Net Zero.”

In fact, nearly 60 percent of such people believe there’s too much liberty in America even though, objectively speaking, we’re less free than ever.

Moreover, in another example of the pseudo-elite vs. street divide, 63 percent of Americans in general oppose the above rationing policy.

Reporting on the story, The College Fix writes that the “Committee to Unleash Prosperity [CUP], in a survey that sought to measure the beliefs of ‘elites,’ stated the findings reveal climate change ‘is clearly an obsession of the very rich and highly educated.’”

The poll, released this month and titled “Them vs. U.S.: The two Americas and how the nation’s elite is out of touch with average Americans,” was billed by the committee as a “first-of-its-kind look at the views of the American Elite.”

They are defined as “people having at least one post-graduate degree, earning at least $150,000 annually, and living in high-population density areas (more than 10,000 people per square mile in their zip code).”

The report is based on two surveys of 1,000 elites conducted last fall.

“The study also examined a sub-sample of elites, adults who attended Ivy League schools or other elite private schools, including Northwestern, Duke, Stanford, and the University of Chicago” according to CUP.
