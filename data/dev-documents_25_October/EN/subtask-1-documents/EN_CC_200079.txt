Klaus Schwab Wants To Ban People Washing Their Pants More Than Once Per Month 

 Klaus Schwab’s World Economic Forum (WEF) has issued guidelines regarding how often the public should be allowed to wash their clothes, including underwear and gym clothes.

The WEF has already ordered compliant governments to move towards a future in which citizens will be restricted from buying more than a small number of new items of clothing per year.

Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.

Citing a new study, Schwab’s World Economic Forum (WEF) is urging governments to clamp down on people who wash their jeans and pants more than once per month, and their sweaters more than once per fortnight.

According to the WEF, the global fashion industry is estimated to generate 92 million tonnes of textile waste each year, and the public must reduce amount by wearing dirty clothes instead of washing them after use.

“Much of this waste could be prevented if we wore our clothes for longer,” said the WEF. “There is no way to make your clothes last forever, and their durability does to a degree depend on the quality of their fabric and how well they are made.”

“One study found, for example, that with the correct care [wearing your jumper/sweater for fourteen days before washing it], you can double the lifespan of a jumper from seven years, on average, to almost 15.”

In an acute irony, globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians routinely utilize private jets to fly into the organization’s yearly Davos conference, releasing more carbon into the environment than the average family does in a lifetime’s worth of laundry.

The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.

Meanwhile, Schwab has kicked off the Annual Meeting of the New Champions, aka “Summer Davos,” in Dalian, China.

During the opening plenary, Schwab praised China for its economic policies while congratulating everyone participating in the event for representing “the most outstanding talents from business, government, academia, and civil society.”

In his brief opening statement, the unelected globalist founder of the WEF said that the participants must “foster collaboration” in order to drive economic growth and create a more resilient future.
