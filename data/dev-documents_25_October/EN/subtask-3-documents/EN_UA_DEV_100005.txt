New Sarah Westall & Scott Ritter: Russia is Winning, Nuclear Threat is a Sign of Desperation & Very Serious 

Former Intelligence Officer and Expert on Weapons of Mass Destruction, Scott Ritter, joins the program to give us a better understanding of what is really going on in Ukraine. Sadly the western media is framing the war as if Russia is losing which only prolongs negotiations and causes more death. The question is, why the desperation to keep the war going? Will they resort to nuclear weapons to even out the war? Another must listen to interview with information that you are missing from the corporation propaganda western media

for the west it’s always been the soviet (RUSSIAN) that has ALWAYS been the boogie man..when in fact they were SELDOM a threat.. amerika always blew any comment about RUSSIA or at later stages CHINA way out of proportion.. and you are still doing …for me …,a poor western subject.. I have NEVER agreed with you..in fact you have NEVER asked me my thoughts ….oh sorry I was / am just your cannon fodder …I do not count… amerikans are the greatest pigs on the planet…and that is in the most derogitive term you can imagine.. absolute pigs

I do not think an amerikan life is worth 1/2 as much as an African (or any other life outside the west) ..they are trash ..not worth the effort ..get to a point of “kill them all” either because they do not care and they want us all dead ..or because they just sit back and “DO NOT CARE”

time to stop caring about the people that do not care..they are the enemy of one sort or the other.. time they took responsibility (rather than consequences) of what their politicians are doing in their name.. Scott Ritter ..good topics ..talking the truth..yes but where is what he says getting us …seems nowhere ..lets get on with a full nuke war…wipe us all out …at least it (for most) will be over quickly and no more of month after month of promises from Trump or threats from the east….POOF..it’s all over …thanks mostly to un-elected bureaucrats in all “western countries” they are proving the worst of the worst of humanity

I am sure Scott will have a safe place he can go .. he talks the most sense ….pity he cannot all but talk about it….most of the rest of the “un Nuclear war countries” will have to survive the horrors left behind of Russia China`Britain (lots of europe) amerika canada australia NZ.. NOBODY asked their populations ..we are just told…but we deserve EVERYTHING we get

really Scott ..perhaps you should take a greater stake in what is going on..stop “talking about it” and start taking control of it ..your government needs to be buried in the flames of hell..too deep to recover …every single one of them ..that means every single bureaucrat you have now ( we will pray for any that are innocent or at least “trying”) they will be forgiven …or at least a chance to be judged by the highest authority..Jesus Himself.. ..I do not think many of them will make it…but it is not my decision ..I am just one of the many persecuted in HIS NAME
