General Milley: Russian military stocks rapidly depleting, soldiers demoralized 

“Russia remains isolated. Their military stocks are rapidly depleting, the soldiers are demoralized, untrained, unmotivated, conscripts, and convicts, and their leadership is failing them, having already failed in their strategic objectives,” Milley said during a press conference at Pentagon following the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.

Russia is increasingly relying on other countries such as Iran and North Korea, he noted.

At the same time, Russian soldiers are thrown into the chaos of war wave after wave. “The severely undertrained, poorly led, poorly equipped Russian forces are conducting mindless frontal attacks and sacrificing hundreds per day… It’s obvious to the world and it should be obvious to Putin that these objectives are no longer achievable by continuing this war,” Milley believes.

Commenting on the situation near Bakhmut, he stressed that Ukraine holds back the Russian troops due to robust defenses.

According to him, the Ukrainian troops are “capable and trained.”

Milley added that Ukrainian precision munitions continued to target the logistics and communication systems of Russians who lack effective small unit leaders and proper equipment.

The Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff noted that nine countries pledged to send over 150 Leopard tanks to Ukraine. The Group that met today discussed air defense, regular artillery, rocket artillery, armor, and ammunition contributions.

“That will be critical to Ukraine's ability to continue the fight,” Milley said, noting that long range fires would challenge Russia's ability to command and control, protect, and sustain their forces.

As reported, the 10th meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Ramstein format was held online on Wednesday.
