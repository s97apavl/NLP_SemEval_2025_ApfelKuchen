European Parliament members clash over support for Ukraine 

 Members of the European Parliament (EP) engaged in mutual insults during debates on the need for further support to Ukraine.

Several European Parliamentarians accused advocates of continuing military assistance of madness and called for an end to arms shipments during debates in the EP’s plenary session in Strasbourg.

“Now it is openly acknowledged that this war could have been stopped in the first months if the West had not vetoed the peace agreement in April,” said Irish MEP Clare Daly. “And you have the audacity to claim that this is assistance to Ukraine. The only ones you are helping are the shareholders of arms companies. Don’t expect the citizens of the EU to support you in this; you speak like crazed maniacs.”

Her compatriot Mick Wallace agreed, expressing the opinion that European politicians “didn’t want peace; they wanted war.”

“We wanted to support the American proxy war to damage Russia. We spent millions of taxpayers’ euros fueling a war that does not serve our interests, helping to destroy Ukraine,” he said.
However, the most robust reaction from the assembly came in the statement from Slovak MEP Miroslav Radačovský.

“We should stop supplying weapons to Ukraine, stop supporting the killing of Slavs. Because if we don’t stop, we, Slavs, will unite as brothers — and I believe we will unite — and level Western Europe to the ground. I’m sure no one here wants that,” the politician said.
He noted that the EU currently has no chance of winning against Russia and called the Ukrainian conflict a “US problem.”

“We must start peace negotiations, but without Americans, and stop these killings,” he added.
